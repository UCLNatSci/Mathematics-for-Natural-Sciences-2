## Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

In this section we will study on of the most important concepts in linear algebra.

```{admonition} Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Let $A$ be a square matrix, $v$ a non-zero vector and $\lambda$ a real number such that

$$Av = \lambda v .$$

Then $\lambda$ is an **eigenvalue** and $v$ is an **eigenvector** of the matrix $A$.
```

'Eigen' is a German word which roughly translates into English as 'self' or 'own'. An eigenvector is a vector which is transformed to a multiple of itself by the matrix $A$.

It is not obvious how to calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a given matrix, and this is a problem we will return to later. However, it is easy to check whether a given vector is an eigenvector simply by applying the definition.


```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

Show that $v = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$ is an eigenvector of the matrix $A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 2 \\ -4 & 8 \end{pmatrix}$ and calculate its corresponding eigenvalue.

**Answer**

$$Av = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 2 \\ -4 & 8 \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}4 \\ 4\end{pmatrix} = 4v$$

Therefore, $v$ is an eigenvalue of $A$ with eigenvalue $\lambda = 4$.

### Question

Given the matrix $A = \begin{pmatrix}0 & 6 & 8 \\ \frac{1}{2} & 0 &0 \\ 0 & \frac{1}{2} & 0\end{pmatrix}$ and vectors $v_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 16 \\ 4 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$, $v_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 2 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}$.

Determine which of $v_1$ and $v_2$ is an eigenvector of $A$, and find its corresponding eigenvalue.

## Geometrical Interpretation of Eigenvectors

If $v$ is an eigenvector of $A$, it is easy to show that any scalar multiple $cv$ is also an eigenvector:

$$A(cv) = cAv = c\lambda v = \lambda(cv)$$

Thus, geometrically we can picture an eigenvector as a straight line through the origin that is left unchanged by transformation corresponding to the matrix.

## Examples

[TODO]

## Eigenspaces

We have seen how to check if a given vector is an eigenvector of a square matrix $A$. It is then easy to find its corresponding eigenvalue.

Next we will learn how can to check whether a given real number is an eigenvalue of $A$ and to find its corresponding eigenvector. This is slightly more complicated because there may be multiple eigenvectors corresponding to a single eigenvalue.

Now suppose $A$ is an ($n \times n$) square matrix and $\lambda$ a real number. If $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue then there exists a non-zero vector $v$ which solves the following equation:

$$
Av = \lambda v.
$$ (eqn_eigenvector)

We would like to solve this for $v$. To see how this is possible, let's first examine a concrete example.

```{admonition} Example
Suppose we have an eigenvalue $\lambda$ of the matrix $A = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \end{pmatrix}$. Then an eigenvector of $A$ is a non-zero vector $v = \begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \end{pmatrix}$ which satisfies

\begin{align*} Av &= \lambda v\\
\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}x_1 \\ x_2\end{pmatrix} &= \lambda \begin{pmatrix}x_1 \\ x_2\end{pmatrix}.
\end{align*}

This translates to the linear system of equations

\begin{alignat*}{3}
x_1 & {}+{} & 2x_2 & {}={} &  \lambda x_1  \\
3x_1 & {}+{} & 4x_2 & {}={} &  \lambda x_2
\end{alignat*}
\begin{alignat*}{3}
(1-\lambda)x_1 & {}+{} & 2x_2 & {}={} &  0  \\
3x_1 & {}+{} & (4-\lambda)x_2 & {}={} &  0
\end{alignat*}
which is the same as the matrix equation

$$\begin{pmatrix} 1-\lambda & 2 \\ 3 & 4-\lambda \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}x_1 \\ x_2\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}0 \\ 0\end{pmatrix}$$

$$\left(A-\lambda I\right)v = 0$$
```

Thus, introducing the identity matrix $I$ allows us to rearrange {eq}`eqn_eigenvector`:

$$\left(A - \lambda I\right)v = 0.$$

Remember that this is an equation of vectors so the $0$ on the right hand side is a zero vector of length $n$.

Notice that this equation is of the form matrix times vector equals vector - and we already know how to solve such an equation, for example by using row reduction. If any solutions exist then they are eigenvectors of $A$ and $\lambda$ a corresponding eigenvalue.

```{admonition} Calculating Eigenvectors
Given a square matrix $A$ and real number $\lambda$, If

$$\left(A - \lambda I\right)v=0$$

has non-trivial solutions then $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $A$ and the solutions are the eigenvectors of $A$ corresponding to $\lambda$.
```

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip
For each of the numbers $Î» = 1, 3$, decide if $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of the matrix

$$A = \begin{pmatrix}2 & -4 \\ -1 & -1\end{pmatrix}$$ (eqn_eigenvector_example)

and calculate the corresponding eigenvector(s).

**Answer**

$\lambda = 1$ is an eigenvalue of $A$ if the equation $\left(A - I\right)v = 0$ has non-zero solutions.

$$A - I = \begin{pmatrix}2 & -4 \\ -1 & -1\end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}1 & -4 \\ -2 & -1\end{pmatrix}$$

$A - I$ has determinant $6$ and is therefore invertible and $\mathrm{Nul}\left(A-I\right) = 0$.

Therefore there are no non-zero solutions to $\left(A - I\right)v = 0$ and we conclude that $1$ is not an eigenvalue of $A$.

$\lambda = 3$ is an eigenvalue of $A$ if the equation $\left(A - 3I\right)v = 0$ has non-zero solutions.

$$A - 3I = \begin{pmatrix}2 & -4 \\ -1 & -1\end{pmatrix} - 3\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}-1 & -4 \\ -1 & -4\end{pmatrix}$$

The reduced row echelon form of this matrix is

$$\begin{pmatrix}1 & 4 \\ 0 & 0\end{pmatrix}$$

and the general solution to $\left(A - 3I\right)v=0$ is

$$ v = \begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2\end{pmatrix} = x_2\begin{pmatrix}-4  \\ 1\end{pmatrix}.$$

Therefore $\lambda = 3$ is an eigenvalue with corresponding eigenvector $v = \begin{pmatrix}-4  \\ 1\end{pmatrix}$.

### Question

Show that $\lambda=-2$ is an eigenvalue of the matrix {eq}`eqn_eigenvector_example` and calculate its eigenvector.

## The Characteristic Polynomial

In the previous section we discussed how to decide whether a given number
$\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of a matrix, and if so, how to find all of the associated eigenvectors. In this section, we will give a method for computing all of the eigenvalues of a matrix.

We saw that $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of a matrix $A$ if and only the equation $\left(A - \lambda I\right)=0$ has non-zero solutions. But recall that this equation only has non-zero solutions if and only if the the matrix $A - \lambda I$ is invertible, which is the case if and only if its determinant is zero. Therefore, we have the following important theorem.

```{admonition} Theorem
Given a square matrix $A$, a real number $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $A$ if an only if

$$\mathrm{det}\left(A - \lambda I\right) = 0.$$

The equation $f(\lambda)=\mathrm{det}\left(A - \lambda I\right)$ is called the **characteristic polynomial** of $A$.
```

## Calculating eigenvalues

We now have the necessary tool to calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of any square matrix $A$.

1. Calculate the characteristic polynomial $f(\lambda)=\mathrm{det}\left(A - \lambda I\right)$ using the rules for calculating determinants.
2. Solve the degree-$n$ polynomial equation $f(\lambda) = 0$. Each solution $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $A$.
3. Determine the corresponding eigenvectors using row-reduction on the matrix $A-\lambda I$ for each eigenvalue $\lambda$.

```{admonition} Example
:class: tip

Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix

$$A = \begin{pmatrix}5 & 2 \\ 2 & 1\end{pmatrix}.$$

**Answer**

1\. Calculate the characteristic polynomial:

\begin{align*}
f(\lambda) &= \mathrm{det}\left(A - \lambda I\right)\\
           &=  \begin{vmatrix}5 - \lambda & 2 \\ 2 & 1-\lambda\end{vmatrix} \\
           &= (5-\lambda)(1-\lambda) - 4 \\
           &= \lambda^2 - 6\lambda + 1
\end{align*}

2\. Solve $f(\lambda)=0$:

$$\lambda = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36-4}}{2} = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}$$

Therefore the eigenvalues are $\lambda_1 = 3+2\sqrt{2}$ and $\lambda_2 = 3-2\sqrt{2}$.

3\. Determine the eigenvectors by row-reduction:

$$A - \lambda_1 I = \begin{pmatrix}2-2\sqrt{2} & 2 \\ 2 & -2-\sqrt{2}\end{pmatrix}$$

Reduces to:

\begin{pmatrix}1 & -1-\sqrt{2}\\ 0 & 0\end{pmatrix}

and the general solution to $\left(A - \lambda_1I\right)v=0$ is

$$ v = x_2\begin{pmatrix}1+\sqrt{2}  \\ 1\end{pmatrix}.$$

Therefore $v_1 = \begin{pmatrix}1+\sqrt{2}  \\ 1\end{pmatrix}$ is an eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $\lambda_1 = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}$.

Similarly, we can calculate that $v_2 = \begin{pmatrix}1-\sqrt{2}  \\ 1\end{pmatrix}$ is an eigevector corresponding to the eigenvalue $\lambda_2 = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}$.

## Solutions to Exercises

{numref}`Question %s <q_check_eigenvector>`

$$Av_1 =\begin{pmatrix}0 & 6 & 8 \\ \frac{1}{2} & 0 &0 \\ 0 & \frac{1}{2} & 0\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} 16 \\ 4 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 32 \\ 8 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = 2v_1.$$

Therefore $v_1$ is an eigenvector of $A$ with eigenvalue $\lambda_1 = 2$

$$Av_2 =\begin{pmatrix}0 & 6 & 8 \\ \frac{1}{2} & 0 &0 \\ 0 & \frac{1}{2} & 0\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 2 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 28 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$$

is not a scalar multiple of $v_2$ therefore $v_2$ is not an eigenvector of $A$.

{numref}`Question %s <q_check_eigenvalue>`

$\lambda = -2$ is an eigenvalue of $A$ if the equation $\left(A + 2I\right)v = 0$ has non-zero solutions.

$$A + 2I = \begin{pmatrix}2 & -4 \\ -1 & -1\end{pmatrix} + 2\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}4 & -4 \\ -1 & 1\end{pmatrix}$$

The reduced row echelon form of this matrix is

$$\begin{pmatrix}1 & -1 \\ 0 & 0\end{pmatrix}$$

and the general solution to $\left(A + 2I\right)v=0$ is

$$ v = \begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2\end{pmatrix} = x_2\begin{pmatrix}1  \\ 1\end{pmatrix}.$$

Therefore $\lambda = -2$ is an eigenvalue with corresponding eigenvector $v = \begin{pmatrix}1 \\ 1\end{pmatrix}$.
