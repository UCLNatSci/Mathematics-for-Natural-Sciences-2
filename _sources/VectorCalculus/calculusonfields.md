# Vector Fields

A field in a mathematical sense is some function which can be defined within some domain $D$, we will examine fields in two and three spatial dimensions, 
(but this can be extended to more later as required), therefore $D \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ or $D \subset \mathbb{R}^3$ respectively.  In a physical sense, a field 
is some physical quantity which has a value at every point within a space, examples of which include temperature, velocity of water in a fluid like the sea or 
amosphere, electric and magnetic fields.  

One impoirtant distinction to make between fields is whether they are <b>Scalar</b>, <v>Vector</b> or some other (e.g. <b>Tensor</b> although this is beyond 
the scope of this course).

## Scalar Fields
A scalar field is a physical quantity having a value but no direction at every point $\bf r = (x, \,y, \,z)$ in the domain. Physical examples include 
pressure and temperature.  Mathematically we can write this as a fucntion $\phi$ such that:
```{math}
\phi : D \subsewt \mathbb{R}^3 &\rightarrow&\, \mathbb{R} \\
{\bf r} &\rightarrow&\, \phi({\bf r})
```
