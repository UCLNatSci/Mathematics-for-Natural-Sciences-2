# Linear Subspaces

```{card} Definition

**Null space and special solutions**

The **null space** of a matrix $A$ is the full solution to the equation

$$Ax=0.$$

For each free variable $x_i$ in the echelon form of $A$ there is a **special solution** $v_i$ found by setting $x_i$ to $1$ and all other free variables to $0$.

The null space is all linear combinations of the special solutions:

$$t_1v_1 + \cdots + t_kv_k\quad \mathrm{for}\quad t_i\in\mathbb{R}.$$
