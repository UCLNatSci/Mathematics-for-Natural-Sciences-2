# Welcome to Linear Algebra and Vector Calculus

This module is designed as a follow on to NSCI0005, being a second module mathematical methods for natural sciences students.  In it we will cover:

- Vector calculus methods:
	- Cartesian, spherical polar and cylindrical polar coordinate systems
	- Multidimensional area and volume integrals
	- Vector fields
	- Gradient operator and tangent plane operations
	- Divergence and curl
	- Line integrals
	- Surface intgeals
	- Divergence and Stoke's theorems

- Differential equation methods:
	- Reduction of order method
	- Variation of parameters method
	
- Matrices, vector spaces and linear algebra:
	- Gaussian elimnination
	- Matrices in 2D and 3D
	- Linear transformations
	- Matrix inverses
	- Matrix determinants
	- Eigenvalues and eigenvectors
	- Matrix diagonalisation
