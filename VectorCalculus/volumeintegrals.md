# Multidimensional Integrals

Although we are used to find the area under a curve from the integral of a function $f(x)$ over some limits $x \in [a,\, b]:

```{math}
A = \int_a^b f(x)\,\mathrm{d}x
```

if we had some area described by a function $f(x,\,y)$ we could try to find the area contained within this 2D shape.  Likewise if we have some 
function $f(x,\,y,\,z)$ describing some shape in 3D space, we could aim to find the total volume contained in this shape.  We think of these 
as multidimensional integals as extending integral calculus to multivariables, akin to partial differentiation extending differential calculus 
to multivaribles.
